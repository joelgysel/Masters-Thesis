In this folder are the detailed results of model testings at different stages. 

Specifically: 
- CV stands for the results under the sorted Cross-Validation testing mechanism
- WF stands for the results under the Walk-Forward testing mechanism

- "WF_Single" and "CV_Single" are the results of a grid search, where, for each individual classifier, we search for optimal hyperparameters, optimal number of variables and optimal fitting window. 
- "WF_Oversampling" and "CV_Oversampling" are the results of a grid search, where we search for optimal oversampling algorithms for each classifier
- "Final" is the dataframe with the results from the final model testing on the holdout sample
